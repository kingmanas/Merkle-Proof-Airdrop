# 🍬 Laddo Token Airdrop with Merkle Tree Proofs & Signatures 🍬

Welcome to the **Laddo Token** airdrop project! This project is a fun and educational journey into the world of Solidity, Merkle Trees, and cryptographic signatures. It involves creating and airdropping a custom token called "Laddo" using Merkle Tree proofs and verifying transactions with signatures.

## BlockBuddy Contracts

## 🎯 Project Overview

In this project, we:
- Created a custom ERC-20 token named **Laddo**.
- Implemented Merkle Tree proofs to efficiently verify eligible recipients for the airdrop.
- Used cryptographic signatures to securely verify transactions.

This project was both a learning experience and incredibly satisfying to complete. We hope you find it as enjoyable as we did!

## 🛠 Features

- **Laddo Token**: A custom ERC-20 token implemented in Solidity.
- **Merkle Tree Proofs**: Efficiently manage and verify large lists of eligible airdrop recipients.
- **Signature Verification**: Securely verify transactions using cryptographic signatures.
- **Airdrop Mechanism**: Distribute tokens to eligible recipients in a secure and efficient manner.
